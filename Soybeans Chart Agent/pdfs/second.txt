How to grow

soybean

1

Planning and preparing 
the land 

Rotate soybean with maize or sorghum to improve soil 
fertility and control diseases. Nitrogen fixed in the soil by 
soybean will benefit the next crop that comes in the rotation.

 Step 1

 Step 2

Select fertile to moderately 
fertile land, with no water
logging.

Prepare land well to create a
uniform seedbed with no weeds.

2

 
 Step 3

•	 Soybean will add nitrogen from the air, 

so do not apply nitrogen fertilizer. 
•	 Get the recommended rhizobium 
     inoculant for your area. 
•	 Store the rhizobium inoculant in a cool, 

dark and dry place. 

 Step 4

Get good seeds of the soybean type 
recommended to your area and 
acceptable to buyers.

Step 5

Test the seeds for germination by planting 
30 seeds, if at least 25 germinate, then the 
seed is good to plant.

Before	planting,	apply	a	legume	inoculant	e.g.	Biofix.
Inoculation is the process of bringing the appropriate 
rhizobia into contact with legume seeds

Directions for using rhizobium inoculants in soybean. 
Seeds of soybean, common bean, cowpea and other legumes are coated 
with inoculant just before planting to encourage effective nitrogen fixation 
by the plants.

Add	4	soda	tops	of	gum	arabic	or	sugar	to	one	soda	bottle	(300ml)	filled	
with clean lukewarm water and shake well to dissolve. This is the sticker.

Measure	15kg	of	soybean	this	will	be	approximately	15	litres.

Place in any container that will accommodate the seeds.

Mix	the	soybean	with	sticker	solution	until	all	the	seeds	are	completely	
covered.

Pour the rhizobium inoculants pack onto the seeds and sticker.

Mix	the	seeds	and	the	inoculant	thoroughly	until	all	the	seeds	are	uniformly	
covered.

Protect the inoculated seed from direct sunlight by covering the container 
with paper, cloth or gunny bag and keep under shade until planted.

Place the inoculated seed in a well-prepared moist furrow and cover 
immediately with soil.

Always plant seeds on the same day they are inoculated.

Planting time, spacing and 
fertilizer application 

Plant at onset of rains when the soil is moist. Roots will not grow in dry or 
waterlogged soil. 

 Step 1 

Make furrows 5cm deep (2 inches). 

Place fertilizer in furrow and cover fertilizer 
with 2½ cm (1 inch) of soil. Spacing 
between furrows should be 45cm (1½ feet).

 Step 2

Apply fertilizer carrying phosphorus. 
If using either TSP, Sympal or SSP, apply 
at 63, 123, 140 kg of fertilizer per acre, 
respectively (see table on opposite page). 
Fertilizer can be measured using a 
teaspoon,	matchbox	or	soda	bottletop.

If using DAP, use the recommendations for TSP. If using the 
guidelines	for	teaspoon	(A),	matchbox	(B)	or	soda	bottle-top	
(C), take level scoops as shown.
NOTE: Do not use the same teaspooon for eating or serving food.

 Step 3

Inoculate	the	seed	(as	explained	on	page	4)	and	sow	
directly by placing seed in furrow. Distance from one seed 
to	the	next	within	a	furrow	should	be	5	cm	(2	inches).	Cover	
the seed with 1½cm (1 inch) of soil.

Crop management

 Step 1

Keep	the	fields	free	of	weeds.	The	
first	weeding	should	be	done	about	2	
weeks after planting and second, 5-6 
weeks after planting. If soybean growth 
is very good, the second weeding may 
not be needed.

 Step 2
To control leaf diseases, spray 
fungicides at correct rates given on the 
package.	First	at	flowering,	and	
thereafter once or twice as 
recommended, usually 21 days after 
first	spraying.

7

 Step 3

If pests are damaging leaves, DO 
NOT spray as this is unlikely to 
reduce the yield; BUT if they are 
damaging pods, seek advice on how 
to use insecticides.

 Step 4

If insecticide or fungicides are used, 
keep records of date, target pest, 
name of insecticide or fungicide 
used and area treated. Seek advice 
if you are not sure what product to 
use.

Safely dispose any empty chemical
containers by piercing and then 
burying.

Harvesting and cleaning 
the grain

 Step 1
Harvest early when nearly all (9 out of 10 pods) are 
brown and dry, preferably in the morning, to avoid 
pods opening and losing the seed.

 Step 2

Dry harvested crop in the open sun and protect it from 
the rain. Thresh and separate on a clean surface such 
as a tarpaulin. 

 Step 3
Clean and re-dry to a moisture content of 11-12%. If 
a moisture meter is unavailable, bite a few seed with 
two teeth. If the seeds stick between teeth then the 
moisture content is above 12%. If the seeds crack, the 
moisture content is 12% or below and can be stored.

 Step 4
Ensure that soybean grain is not contaminated with 
live insects, or foreign materials, and has no bad 
odour.

Proper storage, quality 
control and marketing

 Step 1

Put clean, dry grains in clean bags, 
do not use recycled fertilizer,
pesticide or other chemical bags. 

Grain bags supplied may be reused 
up to 5 times.

 Step 2

Store soybean grain in a cool, dry 
and ventilated place, like a hut or a 
room.

10

Step 3

•	 Deliver grain to your nearest 

collection point on time or store 
and deliver to markets at the 
appropriate time. 

•	 Ensure that grain meets quality 

•	

standards set by buyers. 
If delivered to collection point, 
report information of soybean 
variety and payment method to 
collection point manager. 

•	 Allow for appropriate duration of 
time for payment of soybeans 
after their acceptance at the 
collection point.
