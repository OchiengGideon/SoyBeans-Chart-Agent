Abstract The start of commercial exploitation of soybean in India is nearly four decades old. In this period, the crop has
shown unparallel growth in area and production. Soybean has established itself as a major rainy season crop in the rainfed
agro-ecosystem of central and peninsular India. Introduction of soybean has resulted in an enhancement in the cropping
intensity and resultant increase in the proﬁtability per unit land area. In India, soybean will continue to remain a major
rainfed oilseed crop. A number of varieties that have been bred have resulted in this unprecedented growth. The simulation
studies and on-farm demonstrations indicate that with current varieties, the rainfed potential of soybean in India is about
2.1 t/ha against the national average productivity of just 1.2 t/ha. Hence, large yield gaps exist between the potential and
the actual yields harvested by the farmers. Narrowing of this yield gap may lead to doubling of soybean production.
National Agricultural Research System has so far been successful in meeting the research demands of agrarian and
industrial community. Further improvements in the yield of soybean grain and quality of soybean oil are possible by use of
new research methodologies and by exploitation of recent advances in biology.

Soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) is the world’s most
important seed legume, which contributes to 25 % of the
global edible oil, about two-thirds of the world’s protein
concentrate for
is a
valuable ingredient in formulated feeds for poultry and ﬁsh.
The cultivation and use of soybean could be traced back to
the beginning of China’s agricultural age. Chinese medical
compilations, dating back 6,000 years, mention its utili-
zation for human consumption [12]. To the populace of
China, Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Philippines, and Indone-
sia, for centuries, soybean has meant to be meat, milk,
cheese, bread, and oil. This could well be the reason, why
in these countries, it has earned epithets like ‘‘Cow of the
ﬁeld’’ or ‘‘Gold from soil’’ [8]. Owing to its amino acids

composition, the protein of soybean is called a complete
protein. Its nutrition value in heart disease and diabetes is
well known. It is signiﬁcant that Chinese infants using
soybean milk in place of cow’s milk are practically free
from rickets. Today, USA, Brazil, and Argentina are the
‘‘Big-3’’ producers of the world (Table 1). Versatility of
soybean was recognized in the West quite recently. Around
1921, China produced about 80 % of the world’s soybean
[4]. In India, Soybean was introduced from China in tenth
century AD through the Himalayan routes, and also
brought in via Burma (now Myanmar) by traders from
Indonesia. As a result, soybean has been traditionally
grown on a small scale in Himachal Pradesh, the Kumaon
Hills of Uttar Pradesh (now Uttaranchal), eastern Bengal,
the Khasi Hills, Manipur, the Naga Hills, and parts of
central India covering Madhya Pradesh. It has also been
reported that the Indian continent is the secondary center
for domestication of the crop after China [9, 11, 18]. At
present, India ranks ﬁfth in the area and production in the
world after USA, Brazil, Argentina, and China (Table 1).

The contribution of India in the world soybean area is
10 %, but the contribution to total world soybean grain is
only 4 % indicating the poor levels of productivity of the
crop in India (1.1 t/ha) as compared to other courtiers
(world average 2.2 t/ha).

Indian Scenario

Soybean is the numero uno oilseed crop in India. Soybean
has become an important oilseed crop in India in a very
short period with approximately 10-million ha area under
its cultivation. India is divided into ﬁve agro-climatic zones
for soybean cultivation. These are northern hill zone,
northern plain zone, north eastern zone, central zone, and
southern zone. There are speciﬁc varieties released for each
zone which are suited to their agro-climatic conditions.
There has been an unprecedented growth in soybean; area
which was just 0.03 m ha in 1970 and has reached to
9.30 million ha in 2010. The mean national productivity
has increased from 0.43 t/ha in 1970 to 1.36 t/ha in 2010
(Fig. 1).

The major soybean growing states are Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and
Chattisgarh (Fig. 2). Due to rapid expansion, crop sur-
passed area and production of rest of the oilseeds in
2006–07. Soybean is now predominantly grown as rainfed
crop in vertisols and associated soils with an average crop
season rainfall of 900 mm, which varies greatly across
locations and years. Introduction of soybean in these areas
has led to a shift in cropping system from rainy season
fallow followed by post-rainy season wheat or chickpea
system fallow (wheat/chickpea) to soybean followed by
wheat or chickpea (soybean–wheat/chickpea) system. This
has resulted in an enhancement in the cropping intensity
and resultant increase in the proﬁtability per unit land area.
Introduction of soybean has helped in improving the

country

socioeconomic conditions of large number of small and
marginal farmers probably due to the fact that even under
minimum agricultural inputs, management practices, and
climatic adversities,
it fetches proﬁtable returns to the
farmers. In fact, soybean is one of the most resilient crops
for the rainfed kharif season as despite aberrant weather
conditions in recent past, the crop has maintained its per-
formance. The area under soybean is spread in latitudinal
belt of about 15(cid:3)–25(cid:3)N comprising the states of Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Andhra
Pradesh, and Karnataka. These states together contribute to
about 98 % of the total soybean production in the country.
In recent years, soybean has shown a rapid increase in area
in southern parts of the country, particularly in the states of
Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. Madhya
Pradesh since beginning has been the major contributor to
the soybean area and production, currently contributing
59 % of area and production followed by Maharashtra with
a contribution of 28 and 26 % in terms of total area and
production of the country. The crop can be grown in most
parts of India, and states like northeast states, Himachal
Pradesh and Jharkhand, have good potential of soybean.

Edible Oil Economy

Forex Earner

India has the ﬁfth largest vegetable oil economy in the
world. After cereals, oilseeds are the second largest agri-
cultural commodity, accounting for the 14 % of the gross
cropped area in the country. However,
the country is
meeting its edible oil demand by importing almost 50 % of
its requirement. The per capita consumption of the vege-
is increasing very rapidly due to increase in
table oil
population and improved economic status of the popula-
tion. The demand has increased to about 12.6 kg/year
compared to 4 kg/year in 1961, and the projected demand
for the year 2015 and 2020 is 14.57 and 16.38 kg/year,
respectively. To meet this demand, the country will require
nearly 18.3 and 21.8 million tons of edible oil. In this
scenario, soybean could play a pivotal role. Due to the
advances in knowledge of lipid biochemistry and the pos-
sibilities of enhancing quality and yield of edible oil in
soybean, this has the potential of becoming a major oil
producing crop worldwide.

Soybean contributes 40 and 25 % to the total oilseeds
and edible oil production of the country and earns valuable
foreign exchange by exporting soya meal. Current crushing
capacity of soybean processing industry is about 20 million
t/annum with the annual total production of 12.0 million t
soybean oil. As far as consumption pattern is concerned,
100 % of soybean oil produced in the country is consumed
domestically, and 8–10 % of total soybean produced is
consumed at homes for direct food purposes. Thirty-ﬁve
percent of total soy meal produced ﬁnds its way to the
domestic market.

Soybean is a key foreign exchange earner due to export of
soybean defatted oil cake (DOC). Soybean DOC export of
1,321 million rupees in 1986–87 increased to 8,000 million
rupees by 2010–11. The total expenditure on imported
edible oil was offset by the export earnings by soybean.
DOC, in fact, success of soybean venture, since its com-
mercial cultivation began in India, has more or less been
dependent on the export of defatted soybean oil cake. The
prices of soybean fetched by the farmers have always been
much higher than the minimum support price declared by
the government due to better prices fetched by Indian DOC
in the international markets. However, these prices have
ﬂuctuated a great deal due to ups and downs in interna-
tional prices of DOC, and total dependency of soybean
venture in India on export of DOC is of concern. Soybean
being an international commodity and USA, Brazil, and
Argentina being big players, the dependency of soybean in
India on DOC export may threaten the soybean cultivation
in India. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the
domestic consumption of DOC, so the dependency on
international markets is minimized.

Soybean Vis-a-Vis Nutrition Security

The unique chemical composition of soybean seed, which
includes the number of nutraceutical compounds such as
isoﬂavons, tocopherol, and lecithin besides 20 % oil and
40 % protein, has made it one of the most valuable

123

296

Agric Res (December 2013) 2(4):293–300

agronomic crops in the world. The food derived from soy-
beans generally provides the health beneﬁts and is a cheaper
source of high-quality protein. The crop has potential to
eliminate protein malnutrition prevailing in poor sections of
society in the country. The foreign exchange earned from
export of soy meal is encouraging draining out of high-
quality protein from the country which poor sector of society
needs at an affordable price. The utilization of soybean for
food uses in India is meager [2], and it needs work in terms of
blending with other foods to make taste acceptable. The
high-quality soybean protein should be included in daily diet
of Indian masses to mitigate the widespread energy-protein
malnutrition. The Government of India as well as private
sector should take aggressive approach to increase the food
use of soybean in the country.

Constraints to Soybean Production

Despite having made rapid stride for both coverage and
total production, soybean still suffers on productivity front.
There are a number of constraints, pertaining to climate,
edaphic, production, and technology aspects as mentioned
below that hinder higher productivity.

• Most of the area under soybean cultivation are a rainfed.
• Erratic behavior of monsoon affecting planting.
• Large spatial and temporal variability in rainfall.
• Soil moisture stress at critical growth stages, especially

seed-ﬁlling stage.

• High-temperature stress at critical growth stages.
• Biotic interferences to crop growth.
• Limited mechanization.
• Poor adoption of improved production technology—

low risk covering ability.

• Monocropping and poor varietal diversiﬁcation increas-

ing risk chances.

• Timely availability of quality inputs.
• Poor/inadequate technological information.
• Poor utilization in food chain owing to characteristics

beany ﬂavor of soybean.

• Road blocks in utilization as pulses because of hard-to-

cook characteristics of soybean.

• Psychological stigmas and conventional food habits.
• Lack of awareness about health/nutritional beneﬁts.
• Presence of anti-nutritional factors in soybean.
• Limited entrepreneurship for processing.

Soybean Genetic Improvement

To ease the availability of edible oil and pulses, the Gov-
ernment of India has been consistently making efforts to

123

gear up research and development programs through TMO
(1986) and TMOPM (1991) and 2004 onward through
ISOPOM programs. The ICAR started the All
India
Coordinated Research Project on Soybean (AICRPS) in
1967. Eventually, ICAR established the National Research
Centre for Soybean (now upgraded to Directorate of Soy-
bean Research during XIth Plan) at Indore in Central India
in 1987 when soybean covered only about 1.5 million
hectares, nearly one-sixth of the present coverage by the
crop. At present, soybean has surpassed groundnut and
rapeseed/mustard in cultivable area and production, the two
most important edible oilseeds among nine oilseeds grown
in the country.

The soybean research in India is being pursued by
Directorate of Soybean Research (DSR) and All India
Coordinated Research Project on Soybean (AICRPS). The
AICRPS is an integral part of the DSR with 8 main, 14 sub,
and 16 voluntary centers, spread across the nation. The
system is well equipped with human resource equipments
and infrastructure to conduct quality research. Through
their uniﬁed efforts and with support
from soybean
industry, nongovernmental organizations, and farmers,
soybean is playing a pivotal role in oil economy of the
country. The advancement in research component culmi-
nating to improved varieties and agro-ecological zone-
speciﬁc production technologies and crop protection
modules has been the driving force in motivating the other
components of production system to function in harmony
leading to unparallel growth of the crop and elevated
socioeconomic status of small and marginal farmers.

Soybean Genetic Resources

Directorate of Soybean Research is a National Active
Germplasm Site (NAGS) for Soybean. It
is also the
national repository of soybean varieties and germplasm.
The genetic resources of soybean have been extensively
augmented, evaluated, and documented since the start of
the project, and the total collection now stands at 4,248
accessions of cultivated soybean, 36 accessions of wild
relative belonging to GP-3 and annual wild progenitor of
cultigen of Glycine soja. The genetic resources of soybean
have been extensively augmented, evaluated, and docu-
mented, and a core collection comprising of 51 accessions
have been developed. A number of elite genetic sources
possessing speciﬁc traits have been identiﬁed for further
utilization through breeding programs (Table 2).

The soybean breeding program started at Pantnagar by
screening of 1,400 available germplasm lines in 1970 for
resistance to rust and YMV, but none of these were found
to be resistant. Therefore, the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) was requested to donate the entire
soybean germplasm collection to India. A total of about

(PI200490), Komata
Hondadaizu (PI200477), Keburi

to rust [17]. Genetic studies revealed that the inheritance of
resistance to rust was controlled by a single dominant gene
[15], whereas the inheritance of yellow mosaic was con-
trolled by two pairs of recessive genes [16]. These resistant
sources were used in a hybridization program, and a
number of varieties were developed that combined the
resistance with high yield potential and good seed viability.

Varietal Breeding

Improved varieties, in any crop, are essential for achieving
higher productivity. Unlike traditional varieties,
these
varieties are developed with speciﬁc characters like higher
yields, tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses, and
suitable maturity duration for a particular crop rotation.
Soybean is a short-day plant and is highly sensitive to day
length. This results in narrow adaptability of individual
soybean varieties across latitudes and planting times. The
history of development of soybean varieties in India is
comparatively new. The introduction of soybean started in
1963 with trials conducted at Pantnagar and Jabalpur
agricultural universities, using varieties from the USA.
Promising varieties in these trials like Bragg and Clark 63
were released for cultivation. During 1980–1990, these
varieties were used as parent to develop further improved
varieties for Indian conditions. The varieties developed
after 1990 utilized breeding lines and indigenously devel-
oped varieties in hybridization programs. The yield of
soybean has improved four times in comparison with tra-
ditional variety Kalitur. The varieties developed since 1990
have been grouped in ‘Selection cycle-2.’ The varieties of
selection cycle-1 have produced 4 times higher yield than
indigenous variety Kalitur by virtue of high number of
pods per plant and seed weight, short duration, and

increased biomass. The varieties in selection cycle-2
showed 19 % higher yield than selection cycle-1 varieties.
This increase was due to improvement in harvest index and
seed-ﬁlling duration. Genetic enhancement of yield in
soybean and its stability under rainfed condition have been
the focus. The ideal soybean plant for high yield should
have determinate or semi-determinate growth habit (suited
to short growing season), erect and non lodging, long
juvenile period, broad leaves for maximum light intercep-
tion, rapid LAI development and seed ﬁll duration, and
maturity duration of 95–100 days. Faster rate of LAI
development allows for maximum light interception and
curtails weed growth. Most of the improved varieties are
capable of yielding 3–4 t/ha. The important yield contrib-
uting characters are high number of pods per unit area,
seeds/pod, and seed size.

The amount of genetic improvement in yield through
hybridization and selection has been substantial. Recent
estimates indicate that soybean yields are improving at a
rate of 23 kg/ha/annum [19]. Wilcox [21] estimated an
increase of 60 % in seed yields over the past 60 years
through public sector soybean breeding programs northern
soybean production area of USA. The world average pro-
duction stands at 2.6 t/ha. In India, soybean yields have
improved from 700 to 1,000 kg/ha. The increase has come
mostly through improvement in harvest index, increased
biomass, high number of pods/plant, and increased seed-
ﬁlling duration. The annual genetic gain in seed yield
between 1969 and 1993 has been approximately 22 kg/ha.
[10]. Most of Indian soybean varieties have yield potential
of 2–3 t/ha, while some can yield up to 4 t/ha. Further
improvement in yield will depend on genetic diversity of
parents, plugging the yield loss due to stress and improving
the genetic architecture of the plant.

Besides yield, the other essential characters required for
soybean in tropics are resistance to pod shattering and good
seed longevity. The varieties should be able to withstand
7–10-day delay in harvesting after reaching harvest matu-
rity and should have minimum 70 % of germination after
8–9 months of storage under ambient conditions. Most of
the recently released improved varieties are tolerant to pod
shattering and have acceptable seed storability. However,
bold-seeded varieties are inherently prone to loss of via-
bility faster than small-seeded varieties.

The major biotic stresses, which reduce soybean pro-
ductivity under Indian conditions, are diseases like yellow
mosaic virus, rust, rhizoctonia, anthracnose, etc., and insect
pests like stem ﬂy, gridle beetle, and various defoliators.
There is a need to enhance soil health by use of biological
control agents that may control root diseases and nema-
todes. Varieties resistant/tolerant to many of these stresses
have been bred, and the work is continuing. Being a rainfed
crop, drought is a major abiotic stress, which limits the

123

298

Agric Res (December 2013) 2(4):293–300

productivity of soybean in India. Therefore, tolerance to
is one of the major areas where the current
drought
breeding program is focused. Looking at the future climate
change,
the breeding programs are also focussed on
development of varieties with tolerance to high-tempera-
ture conditions. Despite its rich nutritional proﬁle, use of
soybean in food has been limited because of its beany
ﬂavor
(lipoxygenases) and presence of anti-nutritional
factors like trypsin inhibitor. Breeding for quality charac-
ters and development of food-grade varieties is becoming
an important objective in future.

The total number of released/identiﬁed varieties in India
till date is 102. Out of these maximum numbers of varieties,
(38) have been released for central zone, (22) for northern
hill zone, (23) for northern plain zone, (24) for southern zone,
and (5) for north eastern zone. Some of these varieties are
land races or selections from them and have been known
since long. These are (a) a pool of black-seeded indigenous
varieties such as Bhat or Bhatmash which represent the
habitat of northern hill region, but are also cultivated in
scattered pockets of central India under the names such as
Kalitur and Kala Hulga, (b) yellow-seeded pool of northern
or Tehri-Garhwal region presently represented by JS 2, and
(c) a pool of indigenous varieties with small- and yellow-
seeded varieties represented by Type 49. In Kumaon Hills,
black soybean, locally known as bhat, was grown, while in
northeastern India, viny-type yellow-seeded cultigens were
grown. These land races have given rise to three varieties viz.
Kalitur, JS-2, and Type 49. This includes central as well as
state releases. A majority of Indian varieties have been
developed using exotic parents. Depending on their breeding
history, the Indian varieties can be grouped into two. The ﬁrst
group comprises varieties viz. Bragg, Lee, Improved Peli-
can, Hardee, Monetta, Shilajeet, Co 1, Gujarat Soy 1, Gujarat
Soy 2, VL Soy 2, and JS 71-05 which owe their evolution to
direct selection from exotic and indigenous material. The
second group comprises a bulk of the Indian varieties which
were developed through hybridization and mutation in/
among the varieties of the ﬁrst group. Soybean breeding
programs across the country have also been successful in
developing varieties with speciﬁc characters ranging from
having resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, special
agronomic niches, important processing requirements, and
product-speciﬁc quality traits (Table 3).

The traditional breeding techniques have been used for
the improvement to yield and other traits. The yields have
increased by 60 % in the last 60 years, and 3,900 varieties of
soybean have been released worldwide. The advent of
molecular techniques has speeded soybean breeding. The
ability of genome sequence, the use of functional genomics,
gene mapping, QTL analysis, and transgenic development
are accelerating soybean improvement. Glyphosate-tolerant
roundup ready (RR) soybean is the most widely grown GE

123

crop in the world. These molecular techniques are the future
of breeding programs. Consequently, soybean could become
a major crop for producing high-quality protein, healthy oil,
and oil for biodiesel.

Soybean is attacked by the number of fungal, bacterial,
viral pathogens, and nematodes. The most important one are
soybean rust, Phytophthora root rot, stem canker, bacterial
blight, soybean mosaic virus, and soybean cyst nematode. In
India, the prevalent diseases are rust, yellow mosaic virus,
charcoal rot, and Rhizoctonia root rot. Rust is prevalent in
southern India. The resistance to rust is governed by a
dominant gene Rpp. Four alleles Rpp1–Rpp4 at different loci
have been reported [6, 7]. Indian varieties PS 1024, PS 1029,
and JS 80-21 are tolerant to rust. In order to search for
resistance sources, the germplasm collection is screened at
hot spots. Two lines EC 241778 and EC 241780 show
resistance. Development of YMV resistant varieties like PK
416 and PS 564 was made possible by a source of resistance
PI 171443 (UPSM 534) and has made cultivation of soybean
possible in north India [17]. The active breeding to obtain
varieties with multiple disease resistances the need for sus-
tainability in soybean production.

The most destructive insect pests of soybean include a
variety of foliage feeders, stem borers, gram pod borer, and
stink bug. Although considerable efforts have gone into
breeding insect-resistant varieties, limited success has been
achieved [5]. In India, germplasm lines and elite breeding lines
are scored for resistance to major insect pests, e.g., stem ﬂy,
girdle beetle, and defoliator. Sharma and Shukla [13] identiﬁed
germplasm lines TGX 855-53D and DS 396 as resistant to
defoliators. The wild progenitor of soybean, G. soja, is a
promising source of resistance to Bihar hairy caterpillar [14].

Secondary Agriculture-Based Breeding Initiatives

Despite its rich nutritional proﬁle, use of soybean in food
has been limited because of its beany ﬂavor (lipoxygen-
ases) and presence of anti-nutritional factors like trypsin
inhibitor. Breeding for quality characters and development
of food-grade varieties are important breeding objectives in
soybean. Besides the conventional breeding approaches,
new tools such as allele mining, marker-aided selection
(MAS), functional genomics, and genetic engineering are
being pursued to achieve the long cherished goals.

Secondary agriculture provides an important crop-linked
enterprise to farmers so as to enhance their income from
their farm business and also provide a stability and insur-
ance to the crop economy in the country. Heavy reliance on
export for a long period does not emit healthy sign for
soybean in the country. To promote soybean-based sec-
ondary agriculture, Directorate of Soybean Research, In-
dore, has taken up a number of novel initiatives and have
come out with a good number of technologies enhancing

Future Challenges

The productivity of soybean India though has increased
from 426 kg/ha in 1970–71 to 1,264 kg/ha in 2011–12,

which is still much below the potential of the crop in India.
Thus, the poor productivity and great ﬂuctuation in climate
and yield are detrimental in India. Simulation studies car-
ried out across India have revealed that
the climatic
potential of the crop is 3,000–3,500 kg/ha, while rainfed
potential is 2,000–2,500 kg/ha as against national average
of 1,100 kg/ha [1]. The average rainfed potential of
2,000 kg/ha has also been demonstrated in large number of
on-farm trials conducted over years across India [3]. Sev-
eral abiotic, biotic, and socio economic factors, responsible
for poor productivity of soybean in India, have been
identiﬁed ([20]). However, the major cause of large yield

gaps between rainfed yield potential and actual yields
harvested by farmers is attributed to non-adoption of
improved production technology by the farmers.

Despite having established non-adoption of technologies
as the foremost reason for stagnation of soybean produc-
tivity, maintaining the focus on providing the upward thrust
to soybean production and productivity in the country in
next 20 years to come, the following multi-pronged strat-
egies have been formulated.

•

Improving productivity of soybean through develop-
ment of new gene technologies.

• Enhancing and enriching the gene pool to broaden the
selection pool along with gene ﬂagging to assign the
worth to our genetic wealth.

• Development of new varieties that would ﬁt

into
futuristic crop management regimes and can harness
the opportunities created by shift in weather patterns.
• Exploitation of heterotic vigor to create an opportunity
window for development of hybrids for further increas-
ing the yield potential.

• Exploitation of new biotechnological tools in exercis-

ing efﬁcient selection in reduced time frame.

• Development of varieties with efﬁcient extraction
metabolism to assimilate ever limiting phosphorous
and zinc availability.

• Breeding varieties that could cope with abiotic stresses

like water deﬁcit and excesses.

• Using zinc-ﬁnger nuclease technology,

the trypsin
inhibitor and other undesirable genes can be deleted
or modiﬁed. A thaumatin gene for sweet protein gene
and cloning of omega and hydroxyl acids genes can
make soybean the most valuable oil crop. There are no
limitations of technology. Imagination and bold deci-
sions to do are the scarce virtues holding soybean back.
